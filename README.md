# Velvet F&B Wholesale Companion — Deployment Guide

> This file provides instructions for **Cortex Code** (or any developer) to fully redeploy this demo on a fresh Snowflake account.

## Prerequisites

- A Snowflake account with **ACCOUNTADMIN** role (or equivalent with CREATE DATABASE, Cortex LLM access)
- Node.js 18+ installed locally
- npm installed

## Quick Start (3 steps)

### Step 1: Setup Snowflake Data

Run the SQL setup script against your Snowflake account:

```bash
# Using Cortex Code SQL execution or SnowSQL:
# Execute the file: setup_full.sql
```

Or paste the contents of `setup_full.sql` into a Snowflake worksheet and run all statements.

This creates:
- Database `VELVET_FB_DEMO` with schema `WHOLESALE_APP`
- Tables: PRODUCTS, STORES, FIELD_SALES, STORE_PERFORMANCE, VISITS, STORE_AUDITS, STORE_CASES, RETAILER_NEWS, PRODUCT_CATALOG, PLANOGRAMS, VISIT_PHOTOS, VISIT_MERCHANDISING
- Stage: VISIT_PHOTOS (internal, SSE encryption)
- ~1559 stores, 36 reps, 31 catalog items, 30 planogram entries, 6 months of performance data, audit history, cases, and retailer news

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../apps/field-sales && npm install
```

### Step 3: Run locally

Terminal 1 — Backend:
```bash
cd backend
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=<your-account> \
SNOWFLAKE_USER=<your-user> \
SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=<your-password-or-token> \
SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=COMPUTE_WH \
SNOWFLAKE_ROLE=ACCOUNTADMIN \
node server.js
```

Terminal 2 — Frontend (Field Sales):
```bash
cd apps/field-sales
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

### Step 4 (Optional): Reset demo data

After the app is running, call the demo reset to generate fresh visits for the current week:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/demo/reset -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"rep_id":1}'
```

## Key Personas & Entry Points

| Persona | App | Port | Path |
|---------|-----|------|------|
| Field Sales (Eric Sarr) | `apps/field-sales` | 5173 | `/` |
| Sales Manager | `apps/sales-manager` | 5174 | `/` |
| Category Manager | `apps/category-manager` | 5175 | `/` |

## Hero Store for Demo

- **Sephora Clamart** (STORE_ID 65, REP_ID 1) — -12% sell-out decline, -34% on Lumière de Soie
- **Marionnaud Clamart** (STORE_ID 299, 0.4km away) — -8% overall, -14% skincare
- Navigate to `/store/65` to see full KPIs, audits, cases, visit history
- Click "Prepare" for AI-powered visit briefing (uses Cortex COMPLETE)
- Click "Start Visit" for retail execution flow (6 steps: Preparation → Store Check → Competition → Promotion → Order → Report)
- Promotion step is unchecked by default; check it during Preparation to activate in-store promotions
- Order step shows quarterly territory quotas (progress bars) for non-sellable items
- Store detail now shows visit card with **Cancel** and **Change Date** options

## Voice Interface

The Agent assistant (`/assistant`) supports voice interaction:
- **Speech-to-Text**: Uses browser Web Speech API (Chrome `webkitSpeechRecognition`) with Azure Speech Services as fallback
- **Text-to-Speech**: Azure Neural Voice (`en-US-GuyNeural`) reads agent responses aloud
- Toggle speaker icon to mute/unmute TTS
- Tap mic icon to start/stop recording

Requires `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY` and `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION` in `backend/.env`.

## Merchandising Features

- Store Check only shows products matching the store's **assortment** (STORE_ASSORTMENT table)
- **"Add Product (not in assortment)"** button to manually add non-listed products
- **Facing change indicators**: visual arrows (↑ green / ↓ red / = grey) comparing current vs previous visit
- Facing decreases are highlighted as alerts in AI-generated visit reports
- **Order quota enforcement**: cannot exceed `QUOTA_QTY - USED_QTY` per item

## Nearby POS Agent Flow

When the user says "I have time, any POS nearby?":
1. Agent queries stores within 2km using HAVERSINE distance
2. Recommends the store with the worst performance decline
3. User can **Add to Route** (creates today's visit) or **Schedule Visit** (tomorrow)
4. After adding, agent offers to **send email notification** to store manager

### Stages

| Stage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| VISIT_PHOTOS | Internal stage (SSE) for visit photo storage |

## Customization

To change the hero rep:
1. Edit `apps/field-sales/src/api.js` — change `export const REP_ID = 1` to desired rep
2. Ensure that rep has stores assigned (check `STORES.REP_ID`)

## Troubleshooting

- **"Missing password" error**: Ensure `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` env var is set when starting the backend
- **Cortex COMPLETE fails**: Ensure your account has Cortex LLM access enabled. Check that `mistral-large` model is available.
- **Empty KPIs on store detail**: Run `setup_full.sql` which populates STORE_PERFORMANCE for all stores with REP_ID=1
- **Map not showing route**: Route only displays when there are visits for the selected day. Navigate dates with arrows.
- **Visits count too high/low**: Run demo reset: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/demo/reset -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"rep_id":1}'`

## Lint / Build Commands

```bash
# Frontend build
cd apps/field-sales && npm run build
